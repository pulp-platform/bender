## Unreleased
### Added
- Add `flist` scripts target emitting a plain file list.
### Changed
- `script` now inserts Tcl `catch` statements for `synopsys` and `vsim` to abort elaboration on the first error.  This can be disabled with the new `--no-abort-on-error` flag.

## 0.18.0 - 2020-04-03
### Added
- Add `verilator` and `genus` formats to the script command. ([#27](https://github.com/fabianschuiki/bender/pull/27))

## 0.17.0 - 2020-03-11
### Added
- Add `vivado-sim` format to the script command.  This format differs from the `vivado` format in that it targets simulation, not synthesis; other than that, it is equivalent to the `vivado` format.

## 0.16.1 - 2020-03-10
### Changed
- `script vivado` now emits paths relative to the project root with the `ROOT` variable.

### Fixed
- `script vcs`: Fix shell syntax to define `ROOT` variable.

## 0.16.0 - 2020-02-17
### Added
- Add `vcs` format to the `script` command.

### Changed
- `script`: `vcom-arg` or `vlog-arg` can be used with format `vsim` or `vcs`.

## 0.15.0 - 2020-02-13
### Added
- `script vivado`: Add options to restrict output to defines, includes, or sources.

### Changed
- `script`: Raise error if `vcom-arg` or `vlog-arg` are used with format other than `vsim`.
- `script vivado`:
  - Add `-norecurse` to `add_files` to prevent warnings.
  - Set `include_dirs` and `verilog_define` properties also for `simset` to prevent critical warnings.  This can be disabled with the new `--no-simset` option.

### Fixed
- `script vivado`: Fix name of `include_dirs` property.
